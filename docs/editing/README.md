+ .yarn (precompiled yarn stats (default to yarn and not this project)
+ app (this directory contains the main initialization of the app and its components, this is also where the static files lay)
+ buildscripts (a set of pre compiled scripts that build the program)
+ preloads (this folder contains the preloading scripts necessary for the apps window and other elements)
+ renderer (this startsw the electron layer for other things in the app, for example ui elements and other important components of electron)
